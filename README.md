# What is this?
- A bundle of themes for Ubuntu GNOME carefully polished and edited to provide the best homage to steveOS
- The packs individually already provide 98% of the intended look, but we all know steveOS is all about that extra 2%
- That's when my OCD comes in: Here I provided everything needed for the look, the polish in interface, icons and the addition of the dynamic Mojave wallpaper, all ready to go
- As an extra a Firefox light on dark skin is included
- Several GNOME shell extensions are also highly recommended to tie the room together, man
